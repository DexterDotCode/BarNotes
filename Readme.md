### Non-App Store version

A special version for users that cannot access the App Store. It won't receive automatic updates. But I will update it here whenever new version releases.

[Download](https://github.com/DexterDotCode/BarNotes/releases/tag/v1.1) *(1.1 • macOS 14+)*


> [!IMPORTANT]
> - On initial launch, Apple will asks for your system password to access keychain because BarNotes store your notes securely in keychain. 
> - After Entering password click on 'Always Allow' to avoid this popup on every app launch.
